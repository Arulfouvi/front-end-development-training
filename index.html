              We don't heat or pasteurise our raw, 100% pure forest honey—so it
              varies according to what flowers <br />
              were blooming when we made it. This way we can preserve all the
              good bacteria, enzymes and healthy vitamins while keeping
              everything else intact too. We remove a small portion of honey
              from its comb without heating or pasteurising it; this ensures
              that we preserve all the great-tasting healthy ingredients
              contained within it.

            <p style="font-size: 17px; color: #616161">
              It is not just honey but every globule of it represents one drop
              of blood in our body; tribals say! A practice passed on from
              generation to generation, these tribals go through a lot of
              struggle to acquire the honey with a lot of effort to bear fruit.
              But they won’t stop, they can’t give up lest they starve.

            Pure Honey; What you need to know?
          </h2>
          <p style="color: #616161">
            Hailing mainly from inside the densely wooded Western Ghats of
            India, our natural honey products are seasonally diverse <br />
            because they're processed using old-age traditional practices that
            allow every kind of flavour to come out. <br />
            By squeezing it out directly and constantly stirring up the mix
            without letting it ferment,<br />
            Oorla makes sure all living bees get a fair share by making it
            possible for them to continue building their colonies near potential
            sources of food! <br />
            As a result, these forests provide us with some precious nectar full
            of live enzymes found in no other liquids available commercially; an
            irreplaceable reservoir for this <br />
            species instrumental in nature's creation stories.
